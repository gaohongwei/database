Configure Master MySQL server
sudo nano /etc/my.cnf
bind-address = X.X.X.X
server-id = 1
log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
binlog_do_db = dbreplica

bind-address – the server's IP address. An easy way to find your server's IP address is to execute the following command:
ip addr show eth0|grep inet|awk '{print $2}'|cut -d / -f1
server-id – unique ID which should not be used for another server withing the replication configuration
log_bin – the slave server will copy all changes registered inside that log
binlog_do_db – the name of the database which will be replicated

sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld restart

#grant privileges to the slave server
mysql -u root -p
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'slave'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Configure Slave MySQL server
mysql -p -u root
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
-&gt; MASTER_HOST='X.X.X.X',
-&gt; MASTER_USER='slave',
-&gt; MASTER_PASSWORD='password',
-&gt; MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001',
-&gt; MASTER_LOG_POS=327;

MASTER_HOST - the IP address of the Master server
MASTER_USER - the MySQL user we created for replication
MASTER_PASSWORD - the password for the replication user
MASTER_LOG_FILE - the binary log that we recorded from the Master server status earlier
MASTER_LOG_POS - the position the Master was in that we recorded.

START SLAVE;

SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;
